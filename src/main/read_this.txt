When creating the WORKER use case:
- mantain the annotation number columns in the Peak entity: anytime that there's a new annotation, a conflict should be check,
  update the peak validity counters.

Still lacking:
- MAP 3D.
- Worker use cases:
    - suscribe to campaigns.
    - list campaign.
    - create annotation in peaks.
- Profile for modifying user information.

If we have time:
- pagination in tables.
- set specific messages to forms.
- pagination in map.
